INSTRUCTION (EN, Polish version in txt. file)

In JavaScript, implement Saper (N x M with X bombs) - game
assumption: in this project we create all elements dynamically (we do not enter them manually in the body)

graphics available - https://mendela.pl/lekcje/ap_kli/video/img.zip
font: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Henny+Penny

Please in the form:
- after entering something other than a number, the value is deleted after a second
- after clicking generate, checks if all values ​​are entered (if not, display an alert/box)

Task 1:
- behavior of the form according to the guidelines below
- dynamic generation of a board of the appropriate size and with the appropriate number of bombs (along with an array in the code storing this data)

Task 2.
We add game mechanics. Notes:
- right mouse button (RMB) indicates a field (bomb/question mark/nothing)
- left (LMB) reveals

Time and records remain to be done - the subject of the future meeting.

Task 3.
- add time

Based on Cookie's, create:
- TOP10 records (best 10 times) for any game mode played so far (width/height/min).
- after re-entering the site, previous records are still remembered

For example, a list of records (top10 - always the best 10) sorted by time:
Nick1 - 00:52
Nick2 - 01:10
Nick1 - 05:01
....

and for other modes, lists of their records.

- presentation of records - as long as it's on the site (not in the console) according to your concept
